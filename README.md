# Game-Programming
While I have done quite a variety of projects in this course, I feel that these two
projects have covered a lot of the information that I have learned over the semester. I have
also included these projects as I felt that I had the most fun creating them.

A short overview of these projects:

* **Assignment 10**
  * This project covers the process of creating a third-person game with an emphasis on
  allowing the player to interact with the environment in a few different ways. Additionally,
  this assignment showcases some basic UI elements that the player can interact with.

* **Assignment 9**
  * Assignment 9 is a project that sees to make improvements to a previous assignment that
  I have made. This project is a first-person shooter that contains a basic enemy AI that
  can attack the player should they end up in the enemy's line of sight. I have made a few
  other adjustments to the project; notably including a bit of audio that can be adjusted inside
  of a settings GUI that can be accessed by clicking a gear icon on the HUD.
